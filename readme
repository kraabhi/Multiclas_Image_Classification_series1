This is multiclass image classification where we have 42 classes with each class having atleast 150-200 images. I tried to implement this using fast.ai.
This is fast and with few steps you can see results. Improvements possible by tunning. But as this is first series I will share improved models in future.
This can help beginers in Deeplearning.

Note: Major part of deep learning starts with data collection and bring data in the format model accepts. Later fine tuning plays role. Here images are inside 
one main directory consisting of multiple sub directories. Each sub directory has images corresponding to one character. So the firat task is I created CSV 
containing path and label.
